What is a full bathroom?
First, let’s start with the whole caboodle. In order for a room to be listed as a “full bath,” it must contain four key fixtures: a toilet, sink, bathtub, and shower. A full bathroom off the master bedroom is one of the most desired features by today’s home buyers, according to a survey conducted by the National Association of Home Builders. Other features that are popular in a full bath but are not necessary for that designation include a linen closet, bidet, makeup station, and/or double sink.
